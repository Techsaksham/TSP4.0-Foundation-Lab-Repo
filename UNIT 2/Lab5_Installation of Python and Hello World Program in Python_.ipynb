    "# Python Installation And Set Up\n",
    "The first step to start coding with any programming language is to set up the environment that will permit our code to run smoothly. Python can be installed in many ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common ways are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the official Python distributions\n",
    "Using a package manager (Linux, macOS)\n",
    "In this section, we shall cover installing Python on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Please, identify your Operating system, and let’s get started as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#1) Install Python On Windows 10\n",
    "Unlike most Linux distributions, Windows doesn’t come shipped with Python. We have to install it by ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we shall cover the two common ways to install Python. But before we install, we should first check if Python is installed on our system or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s open our terminal and run the following code.\n",
    "\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "# or\n",
    "python3 --version\n",
    "NB: On Windows, the terminal (Command Prompt) can be opened by clicking on the Windows key, then by typing “Command Prompt” and pressing Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the output shows a Python version, then Python has already been installed in your system. If the version is older than the latest, which is 3.9.1 as of now, then we will have to upgrade it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if Python hasn’t been installed yet, then the warning message below will appear instructing us to run “python” without any argument in order to install Python via Microsoft Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Python on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Python From The Microsoft Store Package\n",
    "We will kick off with this way of installing Python because it is primarily intended for students and Python newbies. It was designed mainly for interactive use and it has some limitations that don’t make it suitable for professional use.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for most of us who are still beginners, this installation method is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before opening the Microsoft Store app and searching for Python 3.9, we should make sure that we have the latest Windows 10 updates. We should also ensure that the Python we are selecting is published by the Python Software Foundation. Here is the warning from the Python official documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: Python will always be available for free on the Microsoft Store.\n",
    " If you are asked to pay for it, you have not selected the correct package.\n",
    "As mentioned above, in order to get access to the Microsoft Store from the terminal, just run the following command without argument from the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Given below is the screenshot of the Microsoft Store App.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Store\n",
    "Microsoft Store App on Windows 10\n",
    "Go ahead and select Python version 3.9 and follow the below instructions for installation. It should be approximately 34.81 MB.\n",
    "\n",
    "This installation process also installs pip and IDLE alongside – this can be accessed by typing pip or idle on the command prompt or PowerShell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check That Python Was Installed\n",
    "\n",
    "Same way, to check that our Python was successfully installed, we can find it in Start, or from the Command Prompt by running the below command.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Check That Python Was Installed\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Python From The Python Installer\n",
    "As we saw above, installing from the Microsoft Store is mostly for students. However, for professional developers who want more control over the installation with a full-featured environment, using the Full installer is the right way.\n",
    "\n",
    "All we need to do is download the official Python.exe installer and run it on our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the below steps to download the full installer:\n",
    "\n",
    "From a browser, navigate to Python.org’s page to download for Windows.\n",
    "Select a Python version under “Python Releases for Windows”. As of now, the latest version is 3.9.1.\n",
    "At the bottom, we can see different installers for both 64-bit and 32-bit systems. For a 32-bit system, we can only install the Windows installer(32-bit) while for a 64 bit, we can install the installer for both 32 and 64-bit. However, for a 64-bit system, the Windows installer(64-bit) is recommended.\n",
    "Python Releases For Windows\n",
    "Python Releases For Windows\n",
    "Run the downloaded Python installer(assuming we downloaded Python 3.9.1).\n",
    "Select the Install launcher for all users and Add Python 3.9 to PATH checkboxes as shown below.\n",
    "Installation configuration\n",
    "Installation Configuration\n",
    "Note: Older versions of Python do not support the Add Python to Path checkbox option that merely helps to set the interpreter in the execution path for us. In case we have to set this manually, check here for instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last dialog will ask us to disable the path length limit. Disabling this will allow Python to bypass the 260 characters path length limit set by Windows. In the future, we shall definitely get to use the open() function and os module, and if we would want them to accept or return a longer path above 260 characters, then we should disable this option.\n",
    "Disable Path Length Limit\n",
    "Disable Path Length Limit\n",
    "Note: Installing newer versions of Python will automatically install Pip and IDLE that can be accessed by running the commands pip and idle on the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify that Python was installed successfully, check as we did under the above heading “Check That Python Was Installed”."
